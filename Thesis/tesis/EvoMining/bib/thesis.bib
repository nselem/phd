	abstract = {La composition monomérique de polymères joue un rôle essentiel dans la comparaison de structures et dans la biologie de synthèse. Cependant, la plupart des ressources moléculaires en ligne donne accès à la structure atomique des molécules et non à leur structure monomérique. Nous avons donc créé un logiciel appelé smiles2monomers (s2m) pour inférer la structure monomérique passer des atomes aux monomères. L’algorithme sous-jacent se déroule en deux phases : une phase de recherche par isomorphisme de sous graphe des monomères au sein de la structure atomique puis une recherche du meilleur pavage non chevauchant des monomères trouvés. La recherche est basée sur un index markovien améliorant les vitesses de recherche de 30\% par rapport à l’état de l’art. Le pavage est lui constitué d’un algorithme glouton couplé à un raffinement par “branch \& cut”. s2m a été testé sur deux jeux de données déjà annotés. Il retrouve les annotations manuelles avec une excellente sensibilité en des temps très courts. Notre équipe développe Norine, base de données de référence de polymères particuliers appelés Peptides Non Ribosomiques (NRP). s2m, exécuté sur l’ensemble des données de Norine, a mis à jour de nombreuses annotations erronées en base. s2m est donc à la fois capable de créer de nouvelles annotations et d’en corriger des anciennes. Les nouvelles annotations nous servent à la fois à découvrir de nouveaux NRP, de nouvelles fonctionnalités NRP et potentiellement dans le futur à synthétiser des NRP non naturels.},

	abstract = {Many drugs are derived from small molecules produced by microorganisms and plants, so-called natural products. Natural products have diverse chemical structures, but the biosynthetic pathways producing those compounds are often organized as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and follow a highly conserved biosynthetic logic. This allows for the identification of core biosynthetic enzymes using genome mining strategies that are based on the sequence similarity of the involved enzymes/genes. However, mining for a variety of BGCs quickly approaches a complexity level where manual analyses are no longer possible and require the use of automated genome mining pipelines, such as the antiSMASH software. In this review, we discuss the principles underlying the predictions of antiSMASH and other tools and provide practical advice for their application. Furthermore, we discuss important caveats such as rule-based BGC detection, sequence and annotation quality and cluster boundary prediction, which all have to be considered while planning for, performing and analyzing the results of genome mining studies.},

Streptomyces species are prolific producers of bioactive specialised metabolites with adaptive functions in nature and some have found utility in human medicine such as antibiotics. Whilst the biosynthesis of these specialised metabolites is directed by dedicated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), little attention has been focussed on how these organisms have evolved robustness into their genomes to facilitate the metabolic plasticity required to provide chemical precursors for biosynthesis. Here we show that specific expansions of gene families in central carbon metabolism have evolved and become fixed in Streptomyces bacteria to enable plasticity and robustness that maintain cell functionality whilst costly specialised metabolites are produced. These expanded gene families, in addition to being a metabolic adaptation, make excellent targets for metabolic engineering of industrial specialised metabolite producing bacteria.},

	abstract = {Streptomycetes are known for their inherent ability to produce pharmaceutically relevant secondary metabolites. Discovery of medically useful, yet novel compounds has become a great challenge due to frequent rediscovery of known compounds and a consequent decline in the number of relevant clinical trials in the last decades. A paradigm shift took place when the first whole genome sequences of streptomycetes became available, from which silent or “cryptic” biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were discovered. Cryptic BGCs reveal a so far untapped potential of the microorganisms for the production of novel compounds, which has spurred new efforts in understanding the complex regulation between primary and secondary metabolism. This new trend has been accompanied with development of new computational resources (genome and compound mining tools), generation of various high-quality omics data, establishment of molecular tools, and other strain engineering strategies. They all come together to enable systems metabolic engineering of streptomycetes, allowing more systematic and efficient strain development. In this review, the authors present recent progresses within systems metabolic engineering of streptomycetes for uncovering their hidden potential to produce novel compounds and for the improved production of secondary metabolites.},

We apply phylogenomics and metabolic modeling to detect bacterial species that are evolving by gene loss, with the finding that Actinomycetaceae genomes from human cavities are undergoing sizable reductions, including loss of L-histidine and L-tryptophan biosynthesis. We observe that the dual-substrate phosphoribosyl isomerase A or priA gene, at which these pathways converge, appears to coevolve with the occurrence of trp and his genes. Characterization of a dozen PriA homologs shows that these enzymes adapt from bifunctionality in the largest genomes, to a monofunctional, yet not necessarily specialized, inefficient form in genomes undergoing reduction. These functional changes are accomplished via mutations, which result from relaxation of purifying selection, in residues structurally mapped after sequence and X-ray structural analyses. Our results show how gene loss can drive the evolution of substrate specificity from retained enzymes., DOI:

	abstract = {Specialized metabolites (also called natural products or secondary metabolites) derived from bacteria, fungi, marine organisms and plants constitute an important source of antibiotics, anti-cancer agents, insecticides, immunosuppressants and herbicides. Many specialized metabolites in bacteria and fungi are biosynthesized via metabolic pathways whose enzymes are encoded by clustered genes on a chromosome. Metabolic gene clusters comprise a group of physically co-localized genes that together encode enzymes for the biosynthesis of a specific metabolite. Although metabolic gene clusters are generally not known to occur outside of microbes, several plant metabolic gene clusters have been discovered in recent years. The discovery of novel metabolic pathways is being enabled by the increasing availability of high-quality genome sequencing coupled with the development of powerful computational toolkits to identify metabolic gene clusters. To provide a comprehensive overview of various bioinformatics methods for detecting gene clusters, we compare and contrast key aspects of algorithmic logic behind several computational tools, including ‘NP.searcher’, ‘ClustScan’, ‘CLUSEAN’, ‘antiSMASH’, ‘SMURF’, ‘MIDDAS-M’, ‘ClusterFinder’, ‘CASSIS/SMIPS’ and ‘C-Hunter’ among others. We also review additional tools such as ‘NRPSpredictor’ and ‘SBSPKS’ that can infer substrate specificity for previously identified gene clusters. The continual development of bioinformatics methods to predict gene clusters will help shed light on how organisms assemble multi-step metabolic pathways for adaptation to various ecological niches.},

In this review, we have highlighted several marine-derived natural products (and their synthetic derivatives), which have gained recognition as effective antimicrobial agents over the past five years (2012–2017). These natural products have been categorized based on their chemical structures and the structure-activity mediated relationships of some of these bioactive molecules have been discussed.

Many algorithms have been developed to predict the substrate specificities of nonribosomal peptide synthetase adenylation (A) domains from DNA sequences, which enables prioritization and dereplication, and integration with other data types in discovery efforts. However, insufficient training data and a lack of clarity regarding prediction quality have impeded optimal use. Here, we introduce prediCAT, a new phylogenetics-inspired algorithm, which quantitatively estimates the degree of predictability of each A-domain. We then systematically benchmarked all algorithms on a newly gathered, independent test set of 434 A-domain sequences, showing that active-site-motif-based algorithms outperform whole-domain-based methods. Subsequently, we developed SANDPUMA, a powerful ensemble algorithm, based on newly trained versions of all high-performing algorithms, which significantly outperforms individual methods. Finally, we deployed SANDPUMA in a systematic investigation of 7635 Actinobacteria genomes, suggesting that NRP chemical diversity is much higher than previously estimated.

As this fourth goal implies a fundamental understanding of microbial speciation, this perspective article argues that translation of bacterial genome sequences into metabolic features may contribute to the development of modern polyphasic taxonomic approaches. Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GSMRs), which are the result of computationally predicted and experimentally confirmed stoichiometric matrices incorporating all enzyme and metabolite components encoded by a genome sequence, provide a platform that can illustrate bacterial speciation. As the topology and the composition of GSMRs are expected to be the result of adaptive evolution, the features of these networks may provide the prokaryotic taxonomist with novel tools for reaching the fourth tenet of microbial systematics. Through selected examples from the Actinobacteria, which have been inferred from GSMRs and experimentally confirmed after phenotypic characterisation, it will be shown that this level of information can be incorporated into modern polyphasic taxonomic approaches. In conclusion, three specific examples are illustrated to show how GSMRs will revolutionize prokaryotic systematics, as has previously occurred in many other fields of microbiology.},

	abstract = {Natural products from microbes have provided humans with beneficial antibiotics for millennia. However, a decline in the pace of antibiotic discovery exerts pressure on human health as antibiotic resistance spreads, a challenge that may better faced by unveiling chemical diversity produced by microbes. Current microbial genome mining approaches have revitalized research into antibiotics, but the empirical nature of these methods limits the chemical space that is explored.
Here, we address the problem of finding novel pathways by incorporating evolutionary principles into genome mining. We recapitulated the evolutionary history of twenty-three enzyme families previously uninvestigated in the context of natural product biosynthesis in Actinobacteria, the most proficient producers of natural products. Our genome evolutionary analyses where based on the assumption that expanded—repurposed enzyme families—from central metabolism, occur frequently and thus have the potential to catalyze new conversions in the context of natural products biosynthesis. Our analyses led to the discovery of biosynthetic gene clusters coding for hidden chemical diversity, as validated by comparing our predictions with those from state-of-the-art genome mining tools; as well as experimentally demonstrating the existence of a biosynthetic pathway for arseno-organic metabolites in Streptomyces coelicolor and Streptomyces lividans, Using a gene knockout and metabolite profile combined strategy.
As our approach does not rely solely on sequence similarity searches of previously identified biosynthetic enzymes, these results establish the basis for the development of an evolutionary-driven genome mining tool termed EvoMining that complements current platforms. We anticipate that by doing so real ‘chemical dark matter’ will be unveiled.},

	abstract = {With the rise of multi-drug resistant pathogens and the decline in number of potential new antibiotics in development there is a fervent need to reinvigorate the natural products discovery pipeline. Most antibiotics are derived from secondary metabolites produced by microorganisms and plants. To avoid suicide, an antibiotic producer harbors resistance genes often found within the same biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) responsible for manufacturing the antibiotic. Existing mining tools are excellent at detecting BGCs or resistant genes in general, but provide little help in prioritizing and identifying gene clusters for compounds active against specific and novel targets. Here we introduce the ‘Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker’ (ARTS) available at https://arts.ziemertlab.com. ARTS allows for specific and efficient genome mining for antibiotics with interesting and novel targets. The aim of this web server is to automate the screening of large amounts of sequence data and to focus on the most promising strains that produce antibiotics with new modes of action. ARTS integrates target directed genome mining methods, antibiotic gene cluster predictions and ‘essential gene screening’ to provide an interactive page for rapid identification of known and putative targets in BGCs.},

	abstract = {Many drugs are derived from small molecules produced by microorganisms and plants, so-called natural products. Natural products have diverse chemical structures, but the biosynthetic pathways producing those compounds are often organized as biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and follow a highly conserved biosynthetic logic. This allows for the identification of core biosynthetic enzymes using genome mining strategies that are based on the sequence similarity of the involved enzymes/genes. However, mining for a variety of BGCs quickly approaches a complexity level where manual analyses are no longer possible and require the use of automated genome mining pipelines, such as the antiSMASH software. In this review, we discuss the principles underlying the predictions of antiSMASH and other tools and provide practical advice for their application. Furthermore, we discuss important caveats such as rule-based BGC detection, sequence and annotation quality and cluster boundary prediction, which all have to be considered while planning for, performing and analyzing the results of genome mining studies.},

Metagenomics is a useful tool in the discovery of previously unknown taxa, but its use to understand the functional and ecological capacities of the microbiome is limited until taxonomy and function are understood in the context of the community. We suggest that this can be achieved using a combined functional phylogenomics and co-culture-based experimental strategy that can increase our capacity to measure sub-community interactions. Functional phylogenomics can identify and partition the genome such that hidden gene functions and gene clusters with unique evolutionary signals are revealed. We can test these phylogenomic predictions using an experimental model based on sub-community populations that represent a subset of the diversity directly obtained from environmental samples. These populations increase the detection of mechanisms that drive functional forces in the assembly of the microbiome, in particular the role of metabolites from keystone taxa in community interactions. Our combined approach leverages the potential of metagenomics to address biological questions from ecological systems.},
