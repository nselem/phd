Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd prefer to not include a Dedication, for example, simply delete lines 17 and 18 above or add a # before them to comment them out.  If you have other LaTeX packages you would like to include, delete the # before header-includes and list the packages after hyphens on new lines.

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting PDF file enclose it in a block like this.
-->

```{r include_packages, include=FALSE}
# This chunk ensures that the reedtemplates package is
# installed and loaded. This reedtemplates package includes
# the template files for the thesis and also two functions
# used for labeling and referencing
if(!require(devtools))
  install.packages("devtools", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
if(!require(reedtemplates)){
  library(devtools)
  devtools::install_github("ismayc/reedtemplates")
}
library(reedtemplates)
```

<!--
This is the way to split your thesis into chapters and then include each of the chapters seperately.  You can Knit the Rmd files corresponding to each chapter individually and then put them all back together by Knit-ing this document.

This is an R chunk and chap0.Rmd refers to the Introductory chapter.  Feel free to name this file as something else, but don't forget to change the argument to in `child = ` below!
-->

```{r intro, child = 'chap0.Rmd'}
```

```{r Antecedentes, child = 'Antecedentes.Rmd'}
```

```{r Objetivos, child = 'Objetivos.Rmd'}
```
<!--- Genome Mining-->
```{r capitulo1, child = 'chap1.Rmd'}
```
<!--
Immediately below is the chunk for Chapter 2.
--> 
<!--- EvoMining -->
```{r chapter2, child = 'chap2.Rmd'}
```
<!--- CORASON -->
```{r chapter3, child = 'chap3.Rmd'}
```

<!--- PriA family-->
```{r chapter4, child = 'chap4.Rmd'}
```

<!--- Conclusion -->
```{r chapter5, child = 'chap5.Rmd'}
```
<!--
Add other chunks here for other chapters in your thesis.  Note that if you use the `child =` parameter, you can't include anything else in your chunk.
-->

```{r conclusion, child = 'conclusion.Rmd'}
```

<!--
The bib chunk below must go last in this document according to how R Markdown renders.  More info is at http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html
-->

```{r bib, child = 'bibliography.Rmd'}
```
