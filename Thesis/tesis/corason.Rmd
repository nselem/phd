##CORe Analysis of Syntenic Orthologs to prioritize Natural Product-Biosynthetic Gene Cluster  

Bacterial biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) known are always increasing, almost all bacterial genome sequenced contributes with new genes and gene clusters to the known Bacterial Pangenome. In consequence of gene diversity and sequence technology advances researchers often have a large set of genomes to analize in search of a particular gene cluster variation. Answering BGCs analysis needs, CORASON allows users to find and visualice variations of a given gene cluster sorting them according to the conserved core cluster phylogeny.   
     
The core genome on a taxonomical group is the set of coding sequences that are shared between all group members, this definition may be adapted to the cluster core by exploring a set of gene clusters instead of a set of genomes. The cluster core attempts to identify a set of functions conserved on a particular BGC variations.  A report about gene function using RAST technology will be provided whenever a cluster core exists and core sequences will be concatenated to construct a phylogenetic tree and sort variation clusters accordingly.     

To find cluster variations, given a query protein sequence that belongs to a reference cluster, CORASON will search on a Bacterial genome database all gene clusters that contains orthologues of the query-protein and at least another sequence from the reference cluster. Orthologues on variation clusters are coloured within a gradient according to its identity percentage with the reference cluster sequences.   
     
Finally, in order to provide an easy to install distribution, CORASON was packaged on docker containerization platform. Software dependencies such as BLAST 2.2.30, muscle3.8.3, GBlocksLinux64_0.91b, quicktree, newick-utils-1.6, and CORASON code were wrapped together on CORASON docker container. [Tutorial](https://github.com/nselem/EvoDivMet/wiki) and software are available at nselem/github. 

CORASON inputs are a genomic database, a reference cluster and an enzyme inside this cluster, outputs are newick trees, core functional report and a cluster variation SVG file. SVG format among being high quality scalable graphics, also allow to display metadata such as gene function and genome coordinates just by mouse over figures on a browser facilitating genomic analysis.  

In conclusion CORASON is an easy to install comparative genomic visual tool on a customizable genome database that allows users to visualice variations of a reference gene cluster identifing its core functions and finally sorting variations according to their evolutionary history helping to prioritize clusters that may be involved on chemical novelty.
