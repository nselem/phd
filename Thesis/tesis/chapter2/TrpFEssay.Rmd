-$-16^{\circ}C$ degrees  (V68 cells)  
IPTG cold $1M$ $500\mu l$ p/flask $1L$   

## Purification 
TrpC and TrpD will be purified by Nickel chromatography using AKTA-FPLC while ScoePriA and D11A purification will be done by Nickel chromatography using vivapure columns  

### Centrifugation
1. Centrifuge on $.5L$ cans  (Cans as big as possible)  
rotor that suits for cans (On $.5L$ cans rotor code is 03)  
Karina: velocity $6000 rpm$  Time $15 min$
Ana: $7000rpm$ for $10 min$
At this point experiment may be interrupted and pellet can be stored at $-80^{\circ}$ on Falcon tubes  
To restart this protocol re suspend pellet on $25 ml$ lysis buffer keeping on ice all the following steps.  
  
### Sonication
We sonicate pellet to disrupt cells and get the proteins. All reactives must be cooled previously and kept on ice.  
  
Add fresh components to Lysis buffer:  
-Add proteasas inhibitor mix $2\mu l$ (Protein Box)  
-Add DTT $.1 25\mu l$  
-Karina: Add Lysozyme $\frac{2mg}{ml}$  $100\mu l$  
-Ana: Add Lysozyme $\frac{10mg}{ml}$($1000X$)  $100\mu l$ 
  
2. Resuspension. Add lysis Buffer $25ml$ to resuspend pellet and put test tubes on an small glass ware with ice  

3. Sonication. After buffer addition sonicate:       
$7$ times sonication $20s$ with $1min$ rest between every sonication cycle.    
Only total time of sonication must be entered on sonicaction device ($140s$).    

4. Centrifugation. After sonication centrifuge on refrigerated centrifuge at ??Â°C  
karina: After sonication centrifuge $25 min$ at $8000 rpm$  
Ana: After sonication centrifugal $25 min$ at $8000 rpm$  

5. Inject into AKTA-FPL previously balanced with Buffer A   (or vivapure balanced with bufferA)  

6.Wash with 5% Buffer B and subsequently with an imidazol gradient (Buffer B) from 5% to 60% on 16 vol of the column with a flux of 1ml/min. Conserve each elution tube properly labeled.  
What we did to purificate Scoe PriA  was an imidazol gradient:  
  
Flask each one with a 100ml were prepared. columns were washed with 20ml of this tubes PREGUNTA: Tiempo y revoluciones de la centrifuga??

7.Recover the fractions that contains the protein that elutes approximately at 150-200 mM imidazol. Collect the relevant fractions. At this point a protein gel can be run to check protein elution

8.Concentrate the protein using AMICON tubes until an approximate concentration of $90 \frac{\mu g}{\mu l}$ ($2ml$ vol approx)  
9.Check purity by SDS-PAGE gel    
on _S coelicolor_ PriA molecular weight is around 25.7 kDa (length 240 aminoacids), 
on _T maritima_ TrpC molecular weight is around 27.5 kDa (length 242 aminoacids)
10. Add glycerol at a final concentration of 15% and quantify using Bradford. Store at -80C


_TrpC important before step 5_  
After centrifuge step 4 :    
Heat supernatant by 15 min at 65C  
Centrifuge at 10000rpm by 20min. Recover the supernatant.  

Continue with steps 5-10 as in trpD purification.  

On protein activity is more important to be pure than to have protein abundance.  

## TrpF activity  
Important notes
-Reaction buffer does not contain Anthranilic acid (AA) or PRPP, neither does contain DTT, this reactives are prepared separately an added at the moment of the essay.  
-Maximum AA concentration that can be used to obtain confident data initial velocities without noise is 150MM  
- It is important, before realizing enzyme kinetics, to determine suitable for  concentration of the enzyme in process of characterization,  to avoid "initial velocities lost" or substrate hydrolysis 
- Kinetics were done on 96 plates especial to measure fluorescence, but from 8 to 8 reactions, i. e. every time 8 substrate concentrations using a multichanel pipette.  

The enzymatic reaction to form PRA was realized using yTrpD at 25Â° starting with the addition of this enzyme at $1\mu M$ and tmTrpC at 1$\mu M$. Measures were made on a fluorimeter (TECAN) using excitation wavelength of 310 and emission wave length 400 nm  for anthranilic acid. Before starting measures, the equipment needs to calculate a series of parameters different for each measure, this conduces to lost time on the starting reaction, but for the PRA synthesis this is not important,  

When yTrpD is added a decreasing is observed on the fluorescence signal, this effect is due to the enzyme excess. Once the fluorescence signal is constant (i.e once all AA has been converted to PRA) the equipment is paused and kept on the same program, so when resuming time won't be lost by parameters adjustments mentioned before.  The next reaction is started with the addtion of TrpF activity enzyme, the enzymatic catlysis is monitored by 10 min following de fluorsence diminishing nos due to the PRA dissaperaing (exitation wave length 310 nm emission wavelength 400 nm)  

Obtaining of catalytic parameters to the TrpF activity 
Once the temporal progress of the TrpF enzyme reaction is obtained (enzymatic kinetics), initial velocities can be determined, with the linear part of the curve were PRA uptake is observed.

Catalytic parameters were obtained by non linear interpolation to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the program Micro Cal Origin version 5.0 considering to the adjustment the standard deviation of the triplicate essays. To this adjustment initial velocities vs concentrations of substrate PRA were graphed.

```


### Preliminar assays to test enzyme activity   (Ernesto)
To test preliminary results we perform the following activity test assays.  
  
We will use $160 \mu l$ as final reaction volume.     
$150 \mu l$ Buffer  
$5\mu l$ substrate at $50 \mu M$  (Stock at $1.6 mM$)  
$5 \mu l$ enzyme at $2.5 \mu M$  (Stock at $80 \mu M$)  
   
Now I will calculate substrate stock concentration needed to obtain a final concentration of $50 \mu M$ on a final volume of $160 \mu l$ adding $5 \mu l$ of substrate.  
$C_1=\frac{50\mu M \times 160\mu l}{5 \mu l}=1600\mu M = 1.6mM$      
So we need to prepare an stock of $1.6mM$ of substrate concentration. Commercial stock is at $100mM$ , so on a first dilution 1:10 named $C_0$, (90$H_20$ $\mu l$ and 10 $mu l$ GTP) we obtain our lab stock at $10mM$.  
To obtain $1.6 mM$ again the formula $C_1 V_1=C_2 V_2$ was used. $100\mu l$ were prepared thinking on 10 reactions of $5 \mu l$ each one.  
$V_1=\frac{1.6mM\times 100\mu l}{10mM}=16\mu l$  
so $16 \mu l$ substrate was diluted on 84 $\mu l$ of $H_2O$.
  
Next I will explain calculus of enzyme stock concentration needed in order to obtain a final concentration of $2.5 \mu l$ on a final volume of $160 \mu l$ adding $5 \mu l$ of enzyme.  
$C_1=\frac{2.5\mu M \times 160\mu l}{5 \mu l}=80\mu M$    
So we need to prepare an stock of $80\mu M$ of enzyme concentration. An example was calculated using again the formula $C_1 V_1=C_2 V_2$.     
  
Example  
We will prepare $20 \mu l$ of stock because we need $15 \mu l$ for three reactions. A little excess must ALWAYS be prepared for pipeting needs.  
_Streptomyces sp Mg1_ enzyme concentration obtained was $461 \mu M$, so to obtain $20 \mu l$ we must add:  $V_1=\frac{80\times 20}{461}\mu l= 3.4 \mu l$    
$3.4 \mu l$ of enzyme to $16.6\mu l$ TrpF reaction buffer.  
Generalizing:  
$C_1=x\mu M$, $V_1=y$, $C_2=80\mu M$, $V_2=20\mu l$

GTP <- read.table("GTP.activity", header=TRUE, sep="\t")
dGTP <- read.table("dGTP.activity", header=TRUE, sep="\t")
GTP.m <- melt(GTP,id="Time")

plot(GTP.m$Time, GTP.m$value, col=GTP.m$variable, pch=19)

plot.new()
legend("bottom", legend = unique(GTP.m$variable), col = unique(GTP.m$variable), pch=19)

```

the two enzymes with major activity were:   
_Thermomonospora curvata_ thermophilic Actinobacteria from Thermomonosporaceae genus, it can be found in compost and participate in the active degradation of cellulose [@chertkov_complete_2011]. 
Jonesia trpF shows no activity

_Jonesia denitrificans_ is classified as a pathogenic organism for animals, reported genome was originally isolated from cooked ox blood [@pukall_complete_2009].  

```{r activity_splited, message = FALSE,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}

ggplot(GTP.m, aes(x=Time, y=value,color=variable)) + geom_point()+ facet_wrap(~ variable)+ geom_smooth()+theme_bw()+theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 8, face = "bold"), text = element_text(size = 12), axis.title = element_text(face="bold"), axis.text.y=element_text(angle = 30,size = 1), legend.position = "bottom")+ scale_size_area()

### Karina second attempt to obtain enzyme kinetics.  
Now we will try substrate at different concentrations.  

GTP is commercially available at stocks of $100mM$
We want 8 different concentrations between 0 and 50mM on a final volume of $160\mu l$. We chose 0,0.5,1,1.5,5,10,20,50 as the eight points.  

Dilutions were made to reach this concentrations.
$C_{stock}= 100mM$ dil0  
$C_0= 10mM=10000\mu M$ dil1 1:10
$C_1= 1000\mu M$ dil1 1:10
$C_2= 100\mu M$ dil2  1:10
$C_3= 10\mu M$ dil3  1:10
$C_4= 1\mu M$ dil4 1:10

$[S] =[dGTP]=10000\mu M$  
$[E]=50nM$
