You can Knit the Rmd files corresponding to each chapter individually and then put them all back together by Knit-ing this document.\n\nThis is an R chunk and chap0.Rmd refers to the Introductory chapter.

Notice that it's also good practice to name your chunk.  This will help you debug potential issues as you knit.  The chunk above is called intro and the one below is called chapter1.  Feel free to change the name of the Rmd file as you wish, but don't forget to change it here from chap1.Rmd.\n-->\n\n```{r chapter1, child = 'chap1.Rmd'}\n```\n\n<!--\nImmediately below is the chunk for Chapter 2.\n--> \n\n```{r chapter2, child = 'chap2.Rmd'}\n```\n\n```{r chapter3, child = 'chap3.Rmd'}\n```\n\n<!--\nAdd other chunks here for other chapters in your thesis.
